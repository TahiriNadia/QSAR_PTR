#Data Set
The data set consisted of 105 structurally diverse compounds. Their placental transfer data expressed as cord:mother concentration ratios were compiled from literature sources published over the past two decades (Table 1). In these literature sources, ex vivo human placental perfusion method was applied to measure cord:mother concentration ratios.
